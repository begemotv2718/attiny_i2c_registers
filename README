Implementation of smbus i2c slave with registers on attiny mcu. 

Write register: view from master (slave replies in brackets)
START Addr Wr [ACK] RegNum [ACK] Value [ACK] STOP

Read register: view from master

START Addr Wr [ACK] RegNum [ACK] START Addr Rd [RegValue] NAK STOP

Seems to work for slow transfers (<5kHz).
